That's why I went

<i>It's gonna be a wild ride.</i>

73
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.000 align:center, line:82.67%
I can imagine
almost doing this
many years ago myself,

74
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.200 align:center, line:93.67%
and my heart was fluttering.

75
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.930 align:center, line:88.17%

-Yes.
-No, no.

83
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.370 align:center, line:82.67%

I'd be so nervous,

84
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.100 align:center, line:88.17%
because this is about really
taking the next step

85
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.270 align:center, line:93.67%
to your own dream.

86
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.270 align:center, line:88.17%
This is about owning
your own restaurant.

87
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.130 align:center, line:93.67%
Absolutely.

88

-[Demetrius] Yes, sir.
-So.

89
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.770 align:center, line:93.67%
Now that you're all here,

90
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.500 align:center, line:88.17%
I need to know
what makes you tick.

91
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.800 align:center, line:93.67%
I want a simple bite of food,

92
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.030 align:center, line:82.67%
that describes the vision
of your restaurant
on a plate.

93
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.100 align:center, line:93.67%
Okay.

94
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.630 align:center, line:88.17%
We're gonna judge on taste
and visual presentation.

95
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.830 align:center, line:88.17%
It's gotta make me wanna
invest into you.

96
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.370 align:center, line:93.67%
This is not a game.

97
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.300 align:center, line:93.67%
This is real life.

98
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.330 align:center, line:88.17%
My reputation's
on the line here.

99
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.630 align:center, line:88.17%
You're gonna have
one-hour service,

100
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.070 align:center, line:88.17%
and at the end
of that service,

101
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.770 align:center, line:88.17%
someone loses
and goes home right away.

102
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.770 align:center, line:93.67%
Service in an hour.

103
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.630 align:center, line:88.17%
Don't mess around, guys.
Let's go.

104
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.100 align:center, line:88.17%
-All right.
-Coming behind.

105

<i>What we look for</i>

who's breaking out.

110
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.900 align:center, line:93.67%
Whoo.

111
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.230 align:center, line:88.17%

<i>your own restaurant,</i>

113
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.830 align:center, line:88.17%
we need someone
at around 75 to 80.

114
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.100 align:center, line:88.17%
<i>And then we can get</i>
<i>right behind them</i>

115
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.470 align:center, line:82.67%
and help them get
to the next level
to get to that 100.

116
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.000 align:center, line:88.17%
All right, guys.
Let the drinking begin.

<i>My name is Torrece Gregoire.</i>

118

Depending on who you ask.
[laughing]

121
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.900 align:center, line:0.83%
All right, so, we're drinking
or we working?

122
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.700 align:center, line:0.83%
-No, Chef.
We are actually working.
-Nice.

123
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.630 align:center, line:0.83%
My dish is gonna be a oyster
with a, uh, granita.

124
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.630 align:center, line:0.83%
My concept is a oyster bar

that is seasoned in this game.

127
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.270 align:center, line:82.67%
And I think Chef Zakarian

[Coby] Hey, Chef.

133
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.230 align:center, line:88.17%

<i>God made me different.</i>

271
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.400 align:center, line:82.67%
All right, man.
We good to go.
Let's go.

272
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.130 align:center, line:93.67%
What you see is what you get.

273
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.130 align:center, line:82.67%
<i>I've had the luxury</i>
<i>over the past eleven years</i>
<i>to run a very successful</i>

274
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.670 align:center, line:88.17%
<i>private chef</i>
<i>and catering company.</i>

275
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.130 align:center, line:82.67%
And as we talk,
we put that together
brick-and-mortar.

276
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.100 align:center, line:0.83%
So I'm making
a Japanese purple yam pancake.

277
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.900 align:center, line:0.83%
-Purple yam pancake?
-Um, yes.

278
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.930 align:center, line:0.83%
With a, uh, crispy pork belly.

279
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.030 align:center, line:93.67%
Like, okay, what is that?

280
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.030 align:center, line:88.17%
This is reimagined
comfort food.

281
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.600 align:center, line:88.17%
-So we got--
-How many seats?

282
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.630 align:center, line:82.67%
I would like to do
anywhere between
50 and 60.

283
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.570 align:center, line:88.17%
Okay, so your average check
is gonna be what?

284
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.200 align:center, line:88.17%
One person, just one person
coming in for dinner?

285
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.570 align:center, line:82.67%
-Tell me.
You should know this.
-Sure, sure.

286
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.770 align:center, line:88.17%
Yeah, if one person's
coming in for dinner,

287
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.630 align:center, line:88.17%
I'd like him to leave at
about $65 to $70.

288
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.970 align:center, line:93.67%
You gotta double your seats.

289
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.330 align:center, line:88.17%
-Got you.
-Great concept.

290
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.870 align:center, line:88.17%
-I like it at first glance.
-Okay.

291
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.900 align:center, line:93.67%
But you need seats.

292
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.700 align:center, line:93.67%
[Alicia] Behind you.

293
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.130 align:center, line:93.67%
Is someone done with this?

294
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.570 align:center, line:93.67%
Yeah, you can take it.

295
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.230 align:center, line:88.17%
There's so much talent
out there.

296
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.900 align:center, line:82.67%
I mean, they have the vision,
they have their idea.
A lot of it's in their head.

297
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.470 align:center, line:93.67%
Behind you again bro.

298
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.100 align:center, line:88.17%
[Geoffrey] <i>But I wanna see</i>
<i>like, "Okay...</i>

299
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.530 align:center, line:88.17%
We're gonna do
600 covers tonight.

300
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.770 align:center, line:93.67%
This is how we're gonna do it.

301
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.700 align:center, line:88.17%
We're gonna make this bank
at the end of the day."

302
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.530 align:center, line:93.67%
That's where you gotta get to.

303
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.130 align:center, line:93.67%
[Geoffrey] Ten minutes!

304
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.570 align:center, line:88.17%
-Ten minutes, heard.
-To perfection.

305
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.700 align:center, line:88.17%
[Demetrius] <i>The time crunch</i>
<i>is on.</i>

306
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.970 align:center, line:82.67%
That's too hot,
that's too hot.
That's too hot.

307
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.900 align:center, line:88.17%
But I want to show this man
that I really can cook.

308
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.370 align:center, line:88.17%
I'm not just, you know,
Mr. Crazy Dish.

309
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.330 align:center, line:93.67%
Don't burn.

310
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.030 align:center, line:88.17%
I really do have
the skills to pay the bills.

311
00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.570 align:center, line:93.67%
Damn. It's all trash.

312
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.370 align:center, line:0.83%
Someone is getting
let go today.

313
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.470 align:center, line:0.83%
Wow. Great flavor.

314
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.700 align:center, line:0.83%
-If she can make vegetables
taste that good--
-I agree.

315
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.070 align:center, line:0.83%
All I ever said is, "Hmm."

316
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.130 align:center, line:0.83%
As of right now,
he hasn't wow-ed me.

317
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.300 align:center, line:0.83%
I think it's kind of a mess.

318
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.830 align:center, line:0.83%
-Do you recall her struggling
to get plated?
-Yes.

319
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.600 align:center, line:0.83%
Distinct roadkill
look to this.

320
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.000 align:center, line:0.83%
This tastes like takeout.

321
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.700 align:center, line:0.83%
Next!
