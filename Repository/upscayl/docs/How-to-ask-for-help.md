GitHub is a powerful platform that fosters collaboration and open-source development. If you're new to GitHub and need assistance with Upscayl, follow these steps to effectively ask for help:

### 1. Search for Similar Issues
Before posting a new issue, [search the repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/issues) to check if someone else has encountered a similar problem. Also [check the discussions tab](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/discussions) for any pre-existing discussions. This helps to avoid duplicate issues and ensures that you're not asking a question that has already been answered. You should also check the [FAQ](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/tree/main#-faq).

### 2. Provide Logs and Context
- To create a new issue, go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/issues) and click **'New Issue'**.

Make sure to provide detailed context about the problem you're facing. Include relevant information such as the logs, version of the software, the steps to reproduce the issue, and any error messages you've encountered. This will help others understand your problem better and provide more accurate assistance.

If you don't know how to copy/see the logs, [follow this link](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl/wiki/Guide#logs).

### 3. Be Clear and Specific
Clearly articulate your issue or question in a concise manner. The title should clearly mention the problem. Avoid ambiguous language and provide specific details about what you're trying to achieve. This will make it easier for others to understand your problem and offer a targeted solution. Our default issue template provides a suggested, organized way to do this.
